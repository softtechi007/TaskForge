# TaskForge
Objective: Build a fully functional terminal-based Task Manager in Python using Object-Oriented Programming. The user can add, update, delete, filter, and persist tasks (to file), mimicking a real-life todo application â€” but focused entirely on core Python skills like classes, logic, file I/O, and control flow.
